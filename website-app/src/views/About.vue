    <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Being social is essential to me, and I always do my best to establish a good relationship with my colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about my work and seek never to do anything halfway. If it is to be done, it must also be done correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        My most significant interest is within web development, and I would like to get a career as a web developer and work within that industry. I spend most of my spare time either fooling around with JavaScript or taking online courses in various programming languages.
